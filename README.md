# Sonar Data Classification Using Machine Learning  

## **Description**  
This project applies machine learning to classify sonar signals as either **rocks** (R) or **mines** (M). Using logistic regression, the model is trained on sonar data to recognize patterns and make predictions. The project demonstrates a complete pipeline, including data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and a predictive system for real-world use cases.

## **Features**  
- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** From data loading to evaluation.  
- **Logistic Regression Model:** A simple yet effective model for binary classification.  
- **Sonar Signal Data:** Preprocessed to train and test the model for accurate predictions.  
- **Custom Predictive System:** Enables users to input new data and classify it.  
- **Reproducibility:** The code is structured for ease of understanding and adaptation.  

---

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.  
  - pandas: For data processing.  
  - scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains sonar signal readings, with 60 features representing the signal properties, and the label indicates whether the signal represents a rock ('R') or a mine ('M').  
- **Columns:** 60 feature columns + 1 label column.  
- **Classes:**  
  - **R:** Rock  
  - **M:** Mine  

The dataset is preprocessed to separate features and labels, and then split into training and test datasets.

## **Installation and Usage**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sonar-Data-Classification.git
cd Sonar-Data-Classification
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.8 or above). Install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### **3. Prepare the Dataset**  
Place the sonar dataset (`sonar_data.csv`) in the `data/` folder.  

### **4. Run the Model Script**  
Execute the model training and prediction script:  
```bash
python src/sonar_classification.py
```

### **5. Test the Predictive System**  
Modify the `input_data` section in the script with new signal values to test the model. The system will predict whether the signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.

## **Model Evaluation**  
- **Training Accuracy:** Displays how well the model fits the training data.  
- **Test Accuracy:** Indicates how well the model generalizes to unseen data.  
- Predictions for new inputs are printed to the console with class labels ('R' or 'M').

## **Inspiration**  
*Inspiration for this project was drawn from Siddhardhan's YouTube video on machine learning models.*
